## About  

Here you can see in realtime how pathfiding algorithms works. You can also draw walls and move the start and end point.

This include :

* `A*`
* `Dijkstra` (modified version because here is not a cost graph)

Soon :
* `Prim`

## How To Run

In order to run this, you'll need to install [Processing](https://processing.org/) first. Open Sketch.pde under Sketch folder and you are done.
